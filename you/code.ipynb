      "  greeting = f\"Hello, {name}\"\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Escape Sequences\n",
      "- Use backslashes to include quotes and special characters in strings:\n",
      "  - `\\\"` for double quotes, `\\'` for single quotes, `\\\\` for a backslash, and `\\n` for new lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 10. Practice Questions\n",
      "1. **What is an expression?**\n",

      "## 1. String Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.1. String Manipulation Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`upper()`**: Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.\n",
      "  - **Example**: \n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    course = \"python programming\"\n",
      "    print(course.upper())  # Output: PYTHON PROGRAMMING\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **`lower()`**: Converts all characters in a string to lowercase.\n",
      "  - **Example**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    print(course.lower())  # Output: python programming\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`title()`**: Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.\n",
      "  - **Example**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    print(course.title())  # Output: Python Programming\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`strip()`**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.\n",
      "  - **Example**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    user_input = \"   Hello, World!   \"\n",
      "    print(user_input.strip())  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
      "    ```\n",

      "- **`lstrip()`**: Removes whitespace from the beginning (left side) of the string.\n",
      "  - **Example**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    print(user_input.lstrip())  # Output: Hello, World!   \n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`rstrip()`**: Removes whitespace from the end (right side) of the string.\n",
      "  - **Example**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    print(user_input.rstrip())  # Output:    Hello, World!\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.2. Finding Characters in Strings\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`find(substring)`**: Locates the index of the first occurrence of a substring within the string. Returns `-1` if not found.\n",
      "  - **Example**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    index = course.find(\"pro\")  # Output: 9\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    \n",
      "### 1.3. Replacing Characters\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`replace(old, new)`**: Replaces all occurrences of a substring (`old`) with another substring (`new`).\n",
      "  - **Example**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    modified_course = course.replace(\"p\", \"j\")  # Output: jython jrogramming\n",

      "This guide summarizes key concepts from the transcript regarding functions in Python programming. The material covers basic function structure, return values, parameters, arguments, and iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Function Basics\n",
      "- **Definition of a Function**: A block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
      "- **Example**: \n",

      "  def greet(name):\n",
      "      print(\"Hi\", name)\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Points:\n",
      "- Functions can print messages, write to files, or send emails.\n",
      "- When a function completes, it returns a value; if no value is specified, it defaults to `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Return Values\n",
      "- **Understanding `None`**: In Python, if a function does not have a return statement, it returns `None` by default.\n",
      "- **Example**: In the `greet` function above, if called with `print(greet(\"Msh\"))`, it outputs `None` after printing \"Hi Msh\".\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Concepts:\n",
      "- Functions are categorized as:\n",
      "  - **Task-oriented functions**: Perform operations but may not return a value.\n",

      "- **Increment Function**:\n",
      "  - Defined to add a number and a specified increment.\n",

      "  print(increment(2, 1))  # Output: 3\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Simplifying Code:\n",
      "- Using the function directly in print statement without temporary result variable:\n",
      "  ```python\n",
      "  print(increment(2, 1))  # Directly calling the function\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",

      "  ```python\n",
      "  print(increment(number=2, by=1))  # Clearer than just passing values\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Optional Parameters\n",
      "- **Making Parameters Optional**:\n",

      "  print(increment(2, 5))  # Outputs 7, `by` is overridden\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Note:\n",
      "- Optional parameters must come after required parameters in function definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Variable Number of Arguments\n",
      "- **Using Asterisk (*) for Multiple Arguments**:\n",
      "  - Allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments.\n",
      "  ```python\n",

      "1. Install VS Code from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).\n",
      "2. Create a new project by starting a new folder (e.g., `hello_world`) and add a new Python file (`app.py`).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Writing Your First Program\n",
      "- Use the **print()** function to display output:\n",
      "  ```python\n",
      "  print(\"Hello, World! 😸\")\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- Run the program from the integrated terminal:\n",
      "  - **Windows**: `python app.py`\n",
      "  - **Mac/Linux**: `python3 app.py`\n",
      "\n",
      "### Enhancing Your IDE\n",
      "- **Install Python Extension**: Provides features like linting, debugging, and code formatting.\n",
      "- **Linting**: Helps identify errors as you code.\n",

      "- **Variables**: Used to store data.\n",
      "  - Example: `student_count = 1000`\n",
      "- **Common Data Types**:\n",
      "  - Integers (e.g., 10)\n",
      "  - Floats (e.g., 3.14)\n",
      "  - Strings (e.g., \"Hello\")\n",
      "  - Booleans (True/False)\n",

      "### Keyword and Optional Parameters\n",
      "- **Keyword Arguments**: Improve readability by naming parameters in function calls.\n",
      "- **Default Parameters**: Allow function parameters to have default values.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Handling Variable Arguments\n",
      "- Use `*args` to accept a variable number of arguments:\n",
